  <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
    an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of
   <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other
   scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well
   thumbed copy of <cite> On The Road</cite>. It had been
   Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she
   spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be
   free.
  </p>

  <p>
    She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under
    a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
    <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.
     Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets
     of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be
      and outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she 
      had something better to do.
